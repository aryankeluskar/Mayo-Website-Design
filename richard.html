            Richard Stallman is the founder of the free software movement, the
            GNU project, and the Free Software Foundation. He campaigns for
            software to be distributed in a manner such that its users receive
            the freedoms to use, study, distribute, and modify that software.
            Software that ensures these freedoms is termed free software.
            Stallman has written many essays on software freedom, and has been
            an outspoken political campaigner for the free software movement
            since the early 1990s. Stallman pioneered the concept of copyleft, a
            legal mechanism to protect the modification and redistribution
            rights for free software.

            Stallman pioneered the concept of copyleft, which uses the
            principles of copyright law to preserve the right to use, modify,
            and distribute free software, and is the main author of free
            software licenses which describe those terms, most notably the GNU
            General Public License (GPL), the most widely used free software
            license. In 1989, he co-founded the League for Programming Freedom.
            Since the mid-1990s, Stallman has spent most of his time advocating
            for free software, as well as campaigning against software patents,
            digital rights management (which he refers to as digital
            restrictions management, calling the more common term misleading),
            and other legal and technical systems which he sees as taking away
            users' freedoms.

          <blockquote>GNU Project</blockquote>
          <p>
            GNU is an extensive collection of free software, which can be used
            as an operating system or can be used in parts with other operating
            systems. Stallman launched the GNU Project in September 1983 to
            create a Unix-like computer operating system composed entirely of
            free software. He has been the GNU project's lead architect and
            organizer, and developed a number of pieces of widely used GNU
            software. The GNU operating system consists of GNU packages as well
            as free software released by third parties. The development of GNU
            made it possible to use a computer without software that would
            trample your freedom. The use of the completed GNU tools led to the
            family of operating systems Linux.

          <blockquote>Free Software Foundation</blockquote>
          <p>
            The Free Software Foundation(FSF) is a non-profit corporation
            founded by Richard Stallman on 4 October 1985 to support the free
            software movement, a movement which tries to promote the universal
            freedom to distribute and modify computer software without
            restriction. The FSF was started in the Commonwealth of
            Massachusetts, United States of America. From its founding (when it
            started) until the 1990s, FSF's funds were mostly used to employ
            software developers to write free software for the GNU Project.
            Since the mid-1990s, the FSF's employees and volunteers have mostly
            worked on legal and structural issues for the free software movement
            and the free software community. FSF hosts software development
            projects on their Savannah website. FSF also maintains many of the
            documents that define the free software movement.
