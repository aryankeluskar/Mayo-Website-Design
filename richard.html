            Richard Stallman is the founder of the free software movement, the GNU project, and the Free Software Foundation. He campaigns for software to be distributed in a manner such that its users receive the freedoms to use, study, distribute, and modify that
            software. Software that ensures these freedoms is termed free software. Stallman has written many essays on software freedom, and has been an outspoken political campaigner for the free software movement since the early 1990s. Stallman pioneered
            the concept of copyleft, a legal mechanism to protect the modification and redistribution rights for free software.

            Works for the GNU: GNU is an extensive collection of free software, which can be used as an operating system or can be used in parts with other operating systems. Stallman launched the GNU Project in September 1983 to create a Unix-like computer operating
            system composed entirely of free software. He has been the GNU project's lead architect and organizer, and developed a number of pieces of widely used GNU software. The GNU operating system consists of GNU packages as well as free software
            released by third parties. The development of GNU made it possible to use a computer without software that would trample your freedom. The use of the completed GNU tools led to the family of operating systems Linux.
