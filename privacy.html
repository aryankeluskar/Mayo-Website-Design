            <p class="main">What is Privacy</p>
            <br>
            <p>Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively. Broadly speaking, privacy is the right to be let alone, or freedom from interference or intrusion.
                Information privacy is the right to have some control over how your personal information is collected and used.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="main">Top Developments of Privacy in the last decade:</p>
            <br />
            <p>
                1) California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (2018): The CCPA provides for many consumer privacy rights. It imposes many responsibilities on companies that collect and use personal data. The CCPA is one of the strongest state privacy laws in the United States.
                The CCPA has sparked considerable state legislative attention on privacy, and it has reignited the conversation about a federal privacy law in the U.S. The act will provide users with the knowledge of the usage of their personal information
                by companies.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                2) EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (2018): The GDPR has taken privacy to the next level. It provides for individual rights such as the right to access one’s data, the right to request restrictions on data use, the right to be forgotten, and
                the right to data portability.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                3) In India, a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar, ruled on August 24, 2017, that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right for Indian citizens under the Constitution of India. The bill says, “every individual shall
                have a right to his privacy — confidentiality of communication made to, or, by him.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Right to Privacy: It is an element of various legal traditions to restrain governmental and private actions that threaten the privacy of individuals. In India, a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar, ruled on August
                24, 2017, that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right for Indian citizens under the Constitution of India. The bill says, “every individual shall have a right to his privacy — confidentiality of communication made to, or, by him.

            <br />
            <p>
                4) Edward Snowden (2013): He leaked classified documents about surveillance programs by the NSA. This vast surveillance was unlawful. The Snowden revelations generated significant debate about government surveillance.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                5) EU Right to be Forgotten (2012): The law allows EU citizens to submit requests to search engines to have personal information delinked from the results of searching their name.

                Protecting the end user:
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>End-user protection is the process of stopping unauthorized agents and campaigns from targeting endpoints or access points of end-user computers such as desktops, notebooks, and handheld devices. End-users can be protected by having strong
                passwords, updating the systems regularly, using VPNs and encrypting data on end-points.</p>
