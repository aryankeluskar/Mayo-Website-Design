            Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based
            on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on
            September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.The primary difference between
            Linux and many other popular contemporary operating systems is that
            the Linux kernel and other components are free and open-source
            software. Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and
            open-source software collaboration.The source code may be used,
            modified and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone
            under the terms of its respective licenses, such as the GNU General
            Public License..Distributions include the Linux kernel and
            supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided
            by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in
            their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name
            "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing
            some controversy. Popular Linux distributions include Debian,
            Fedora, and Ubuntu. Linux is one of the most prominent examples of
            free and open-source software collaboration.

            Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution. Ubuntu is the modern, open
            source operating system on Linux for the enterprise server, desktop,
            cloud, and IoT. Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Debian and
            composed mostly of free and open-source software. Ubuntu is
            officially released in three editions: Desktop, Server, and Core. As
            of 22 April 2021, the most recent long-term support release is 20.04
            ("Focal Fossa"). Ubuntu is built on Debian's architecture and
            infrastructure, and comprises Linux server, desktop and discontinued
            phone and tablet operating system versions. Ubuntu releases updated
            versions predictably every six months, and each release receives
            free support for nine months (eighteen months prior to 13.04) with
            security fixes, high-impact bug fixes and conservative,
            substantially beneficial low-risk bug fixes. The first release was
            in October 2004. Ubuntu is currently funded by Canonical Ltd. On 8
            July 2005, Mark Shuttleworth and Canonical announced the creation of
            the Ubuntu Foundation and provided initial funding of US$10 million.
            The purpose of the foundation is to ensure the support and
            development for all future versions of Ubuntu. Mark Shuttleworth
            describes the foundation goal as to ensure the continuity of the
            Ubuntu project.
