            The Information Technology Act, 2000 is an Act of the Indian Parliament. The bill was passed in the budget session of 2000. The Act provides a legal framework for electronic governance by giving recognition to electronic records and digital signatures.
            It also defines cyber crimes and prescribes penalties for them. It is the primary law in India dealing with cybercrime and electronic commerce. The original Act contained 94 sections, divided into 13 chapters and 4 schedules. A major amendment
            was made in 2008, which introduced Section 66A.

            Right to Privacy: The right to privacy is an element of various legal traditions to restrain governmental and private actions that threaten the privacy of individuals. In India, a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar,
            ruled on August 24, 2017, that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right for Indian citizens under the Constitution of India. The bill says, “every individual shall have a right to his privacy — confidentiality of communication made to,
            or, by him.
