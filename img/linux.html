            Open-source software is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose. Linux is a family of
            open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration.
            The source code may be used, modified and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone under the terms of its respective licenses. Popular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu. Ubuntu is the modern, open source
            operating system on Linux for the enterprise server, desktop, cloud, and IoT. Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software. Ubuntu is officially released in three editions: Desktop, Server,
            and Core. As of 22 April 2021, the most recent long-term support release is 20.04 ("Focal Fossa")
