            Edward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is a former computer
            intelligence consultant who leaked highly classified information
            from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 when he was an
            employee and subcontractor for the Central Intelligence Agency
            (CIA). His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance
            programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence
            Alliance. He released top secret NSA documents proving the United
            States Government was monitoring phone calls, emails, webcams of its
            own citizens. His job at the NSA allowed him access to them. He has
            said, "I do not want to live in a world where anything I do or say
            is recorded."

            After attending a 2006 job-fair focused on intelligence agencies,
            Snowden accepted an offer for a position at the CIA. The Agency
            assigned him to the global communications division at CIA
            headquarters in Langley, Virginia.On March 15, 2013 – three days
            after what he later called his "breaking point" of "seeing the
            Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under
            oath to Congress" – Snowden quit his job at Dell.At the time of his
            departure from the U.S. in May 2013, he had been employed for 15
            months inside the NSA's Hawaii regional operations center, which
            focuses on the electronic monitoring of China and North Korea, first
            for Dell and then for two months with Booz Allen Hamilton.

            The exact size of Snowden's disclosure is unknown, but Australian
            officials have estimated 15,000 or more Australian intelligence
            files and British officials estimate at least 58,000 British
            intelligence files were included. NSA Director Keith Alexander
            initially estimated that Snowden had copied anywhere from 50,000 to
            200,000 NSA documents. Later estimates provided by U.S. officials
            were in the order of 1.7 million, a number that originally came from
            Department of Defense talking points.

            It was revealed that the NSA was harvesting millions of email and
            instant messaging contact lists, searching email content, tracking
            and mapping the location of cell phones, undermining attempts at
            encryption via Bullrun and that the agency was using cookies to
            piggyback on the same tools used by Internet advertisers "to
            pinpoint targets for government hacking and to bolster
            surveillance." The NSA was shown to be secretly accessing Yahoo and
            Google data centers to collect information from hundreds of millions
            of account holders worldwide by tapping undersea cables using the
            MUSCULAR surveillance program.
